# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
# 
# Approach: Sliding Window
# 
# In any sliding window based problem we have two pointers. One right pointer whose job is to expand the current window and then we have 
# the left pointer whose job is to contract a given window. At any point in time only one of these pointers move and the other 
# one remains fixed.
# 
# The solution is pretty intuitive. We keep expanding the window by moving the right pointer. When the window has reached the limit of 0's allowed,
# we contract (if possible) and save the longest window till now.
# 
# Start at left = 0, right = 0, window_size = 0
# 
# We use the right pointer to expand the window until the window/subarray is desirable. i.e. number of 0's in the window are in the allowed range of [0, k].
# 
# Once we have a window which has more than the allowed number of 0's, we can move the left pointer ahead one by one until we encounter 0 on the left too. 
# This step ensures we are throwing out the extra zero.
# 
# We can make this even more efficient.  Since we have to find the MAXIMUM window, we never reduce the size of the window. We either increase the size of the 
# window or let it remain the same, but never reduce the size.

 
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        ln = len(nums)
        for right in range(ln):
            # if we include a 0 in the window, we reduce the vvalue of k by 1
            k -= 1 - nums[right] # this will do k-1 if nums[right] == 0, else k-0
            # a -ve k denotes we consumed all the ks and the window has more than allowed 0s
            # hence, we increment left pointer by 1
            if k < 0:
                # if the left element to be thrown out of the window is 0, we increase the k by 1
                k += 1 - nums[left]
                left += 1
	# Since, we never reduce the window beyond current max length, in the end, the window size will be the maximum it can be.
        return right - left + 1
